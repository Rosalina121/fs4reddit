# fs4reddit

## Apollo cheap knockoff
**fs4reddit** is a shameless clone (or a cheap knockoff) of Apollo for iOS.  
Made because the CEO of Reddit drives the site and 3rd party apps straight to the ground, and what a better way to prepare for the corporate takeover of the market if not creating a silly app and learning Flutter along the way.

FS stands for something, but I'm not going on record for what exactly. Definitely not "File System" or "Family Site". You can still take a wild guess though.

## Aim of the project
Get at least a bit of feature parity with latest Apollo version (something not even official Reddit app attempts). That includes:
- [ ] Swipe gestures
  - [ ] Customizable ones at that
- [ ] Native look and feel on iOS (and since it's Flutter, then Android too, why not)
- [ ] Other stuff I'm not putting on a road map yet because I don't want to become a feature creep
